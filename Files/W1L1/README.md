1. Design a block using some data and mine to understand the change in values of Nonce and hash key. <div align="center"> <img src="images/1.png"> </div>

2. Design a blockchain using some data and mine to understand the change in values of previous and next hash key. <div align="center"> <img src="images/2.png"> </div>

3. Design a distributed blocks of chain and mine to undestand the change in values of previous and next hash of different peers. <div align="center"> <img src="images/3.png"> </div>

4. Design a blocks of token and mine to understand the change in nonce values. And also observe change in values of previous and next hash keys. <div align="center"> <img src="images/4.png"> </div>

5. Design a coin base of blockchain and understand the change in nonce values. Also, we observe change in previous and next hash keys. <div align="center"> <img src="images/5.png"> </div>
