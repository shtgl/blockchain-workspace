### Problem statement 
*Demonstrate Solidity programming of simple smart contract URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/solidity_first_application.html, URL: https://remix.ethereum.org/*

1. Explore the contracts in remix ide in solidity programming language.<div align="center"> <img src="images/1.png"> </div> <div align="center"> <img src="images/2.png"> </div> We can create a function of addition using basic arithmetic operators. To run the contract, we can use pragma solidity and version as the library. Include the license before deploying the contract.
