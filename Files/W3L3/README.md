### Problem statement 
*Blockchain explorer for Bitcoin and Ethereum – Study and understand the various statistics observations related to bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies, https://www.blockchain.com/explorer, https://etherscan.io/*

1. Explore the explorer section of blockchain.com web interface. <div align="center"> <img src="images/1.png"> </div> In explorer section, we can get to know about a blockchain currency. This includes Bitcoin. We can visualize currencies through a graph, get latest prices of the Bitcoin, get most recent transactions of a currency here Bitcoin. We can also view latest blocks created in the Bitcoin

2. Explore the price section of blockchain.com web interface. <div align="center"> <img src="images/2.png"> </div>In prices section, we can get to know the prices of other cryptocurrencies. <div align="center"> <img src="images/3.png"> </div> <div align="center"> <img src="images/4.png"> </div> <div align="center"> <img src="images/5.png"> </div> A cryptocurrency, when selected from the list of the currencies, we can get to know the information about the currency. When a new block is generated, a unique id is also generated to a particular block.

3. Explore the NFT section of blockchain.com web interface.  <div align="center"> <img src="images/6.png"> </div> Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. Encryption functions generate unique tokens from metadata. Blockchains then store the data, while the assets themselves are stored in other places. The connection between the token and the asset is what makes them unique. NFTs can be traded and exchanged for money, cryptocurrencies, or other NFTs—it all depends on the value the market and owners have placed on them. For instance, you could draw a smiley face on a banana, take a picture of it (which has metadata attached to it), and tokenize it on a blockchain. Whoever has the private keys to that token owns whatever rights you have assigned to the token.
Cryptocurrencies are tokens as well; however, the key difference is that two cryptocurrencies from the same blockchain are interchangeable—they are fungible. Two NFTs from the same blockchain can look identical, but they are not interchangeable.

4. Explore the Wallet section of blockchain.com web interface. <div align="center"> <img src="images/7.png"> </div> E-wallets allow individuals to store cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.

The Blockchain Wallet interface shows the current wallet balance for crypto-assets and the user’s most recent transactions. Users can also access the price charts and see the value of the funds in the chosen local currency of the user.
