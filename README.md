## Sublime dev settings
*Supports macOS, Windows, or Linux*

Every developer needs settings that suit their practical thinking and provide a focused environment. This helps them design functional and efficient code. I am sharing a file of Sublime preferences for day-to-day coding. We can choose any preferences based on which settings are more practical. 

To access the preferences, follow below steps - 
1. Click on the "Preferences" button in the menu bar.

2. Select the "Settings" option from the "Preferences" menu.<div align="center" > <img src="steps/9.png"> </div>

3. The above step opens a side-by-side window. Most likely, on your system, the default Sublime settings will be on the left-hand side. To add custom settings, you can edit them in the window on the right-hand side.

4. Copy and paste preferences into your `Preferences.sublime-settings` file to replicate the settings.<div align="center" > <img src="steps/10.png"> </div>

5. Congratulations! You have successfully added the custom settings to your Sublime environment.
